# GSNCASCR
Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis with Single Cell RNA-seq

GSNCASCR is a R package for pathway level co-expression analysis from single cell RNA-sequencing data. It intergates the advantages of GCNCA and CS-CORE.

We use the single cell RNA-sequencing data on PBMC from COVID patients and healthy controls from Nature Medicine volume 26, pages1070â€“1076 (2020).
